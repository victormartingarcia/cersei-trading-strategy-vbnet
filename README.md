Overview
----

Cersei is a trading algorithm written in C# using the [TradingMotion SDK] development tools (there is a [VB.net] port too).

The strategy code is all contained in [CerseiStrategy.cs], including a default parameter combination.

This default parameter combination has been optimized to run over 60' bars of _IBEX Future Index_.

Trading a maximum of 1 contract of IBEX Future, this is how performed (hypothetically) from 2001 to 20014:

Anyway, go open Visual Studio, clone the project and start with the trading algo development! Sure you can do better and improve all these figures :)

Cersei Trading Rules
----

Cersei's trading plan is quite simple. It __buys 1 contract__ when the price breaks above a specified rate-of-change (Momentum) level.

While the strategy has a long position in the market, it __places one exit order__. A _Trailing Stop_ (keep locking profits while the price is moving in our favour).

Besides, this is a pure __intraday strategy__. That means it won't leave any open position at the end of the session, so in case we still got a position it will be closed automatically.

### To sum up ###
```
CerseiStrategy rules:

  * Entry: Price breaks ROCR100 (Momentum) level (long-only)
  * Exit: Sets a Trailing Stop
  * Filters (sets the entry only under certain conditions): None
```

### Show me the code ###

Here is a simplified C# source code of Cersei's _OnNewBar()_ function. The complete code is all contained in [CerseiStrategy.cs] along with comments and definition of parameters.

```csharp
decimal stopMargin = (decimal)this.GetInputParameter("Trailing Stop Loss ticks distance") * this.GetMainChart().Symbol.TickSize;

int buySignal = (int)this.GetInputParameter("ROCR 100 Buy signal trigger level");

// ========== ENTRY ==========
if (rocr100Indicator.GetROCR100()[1] <= buySignal && rocr100Indicator.GetROCR100()[0] > buySignal && this.GetOpenPosition() == 0)
{
    // BUY SIGNAL: Entering long and placing a trailing stop loss
    MarketOrder buyOrder = new MarketOrder(OrderSide.Buy, 1, "Enter long position");
    trailingStopOrder = new StopOrder(OrderSide.Sell, 1, this.Bars.Close[0] - stopMargin, "Trailing stop long exit");

    this.InsertOrder(buyOrder);
    this.InsertOrder(trailingStopOrder);

    // Resetting acceleration and highest close
    acceleration = 0.02m;
    highestClose = Bars.Close[0];
}
// ========== EXIT ==========
else if (this.GetOpenPosition() == 1)
{
    // Checking if the price has moved in our favour
    if (this.Bars.Close[0] > highestClose)
    {
        highestClose = this.Bars.Close[0];

        // Increasing acceleration
        acceleration = acceleration * (highestClose - trailingStopOrder.Price);

        // Checking if trailing the stop order would exceed the current market price
        if (trailingStopOrder.Price + acceleration < this.Bars.Close[0])
        {
            // Setting the new price for the trailing stop
            trailingStopOrder.Price = trailingStopOrder.Price + acceleration;
            this.ModifyOrder(trailingStopOrder);
        }
        else
        {
            // Cancelling the order and closing the position
            MarketOrder exitLongOrder = new MarketOrder(OrderSide.Sell, 1, "Exit long position");

            this.InsertOrder(exitLongOrder);
            this.CancelOrder(trailingStopOrder);
        }
    }
}
```

Download
----

First of all, make sure you have Visual Studio 2010 version (or higher). [TradingMotion SDK] is fully compatible with [Visual Studio Express] free versions.

Download TradingMotion [Visual Studio extension], and the windows desktop application [TradingMotionSDK Toolkit installer].


Quick Start
----

* Create a free account to access TradingMotionAPI (required). It can be created from TradingMotionSDK Toolkit (the desktop application)
* Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/victormartingarcia/Cersei-trading-strategy-csharp
```
* Open Visual Studio and load solution _CerseiStrategy/CerseiStrategy.sln_
* Edit _app.config_ file adding your TradingMotionAPI credentials on _appSettings_ section

And you're all set!

Running the project (F5) will perform a _development backtest simulation_ over last 6 months DAX 60' bars data.

Once it has finished, it will ask if you want to see the P&L report in TradingMotionSDK Toolkit. Pressing 'y' will load the same backtest with the desktop app, where it will show performance statistics, charts, and so on.
